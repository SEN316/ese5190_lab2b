## Proposal (tentative) : Virtual Character Information Customization based on RP2040
* Introduction
With the rapid grow of virtual reality technology, especially its application in some host RPG(role play games) like Pokemo:GO, SWORD ART ONLINE and STAR WARS, more and more players have got an immersive experience surfing fantasy world as if they are the main chracter. But it seems always annoying when starting a new character by chaging the modeling parameters in the game, so why don't we use a more time-saving way to get started with the main character who just acts as your cyber substitute This project demos a virtual character customization using human face recognition based on RP2040. More comprehensive modules will be included as follows.


| Component     | 	Number | Note     |
| :---            |    :----:   |   :--- |
|RP2040	          |1	          |core microprocessor|
|ATK_Dual_OV5640	|1	          |Binocular camera module for image sampling|
|APDS-9960	      |1	          |Proximity, Light, RGB, and Gesture Sensor|
|WM8978-MP3 	    |1	          |Vioce input module|
|DuPont line	    |some	        |jumper wire|
|Breadboard     	|1	          |platform for circuit construction|
|STEMMA QT	      |1	          |Connection of peripheral dvice with GPIO of RP2040|
